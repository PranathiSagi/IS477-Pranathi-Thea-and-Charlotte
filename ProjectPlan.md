# IS477-Sagi & Kidwell & Shafer

Our team for the IS 477 Project is Pranathi Sagi, the owner of the repository, Thea Kidwell, and Charlotte Shafer.

**Overview:** In the digital age, media is becoming more varied between both digital media and traditional, physical objects. There is more digital media available than ever before. Due to this increase in digital media, art is easier to create and distribute. This poses an interesting opportunity for museums to incorporate digital media into their catalogues, blending traditional art curation methods with contemporary data archival practices. Our overall goal for this project is to analyze the historical and current practices of the National Art Museum to gain a better understanding of the trends in art curation practices in the United States. We will integrate several datasets provided by the National Art Museum and analyze them using SQL.

**Team:** The three of us worked together to draft a project plan and decide on research questions. Once we chose the dataset we wanted to use, we divided it among each group member equally and decided our responsibilities would be to analyze the CSV files and clean them up for easier use when necessary. We have each made the commitment to each other that we will meet up multiple times outside of class to work on this project together. 

Pranathi is focusing on the Objects CSV and text data, specifically looking at each of the artworks, their publication dates in the museum, and what specific collections they come from. This information about each of the unique artworks being represented in the gallery, in addition to the collections they belong to, helps us get an in-depth understanding of ways we can answer our research questions when connecting older and modern works of art in this museum. This also helps us answer our first research question when it comes to analyzing the relationship between these artworks that are digital compared to traditional, to help us answer the discrepancies between both of these. Thea will focus on the constituents and objects_constituents files. Charlotte will focus on the Media_items and Media_relationships files, working with Pranathi to integrate data on media objects with the overall Objects dataset.


Research or Business Question(s): What is/are the question(s) you intend to address? These could be research questions, business questions, or analytical questions you want to answer through data analysis.

Datasets: Identify and describe the datasets you will use to answer your question(s). You need to use at least two different datasets that complement each other and can be integrated together. (for Group of 3, you are required to choose at least three different datasets!) The datasets should each contribute different but related information needed to address your questions, and they must share common attributes or identifiers that allow you to link them. For example, if one dataset contains demographic information and another contains economic indicators, they should both include geographic codes or time periods that enable meaningful integration.If you need help finding suitable datasets, start by reviewing the list of datasets provided in class. 

Kaggle Clause: First, they can be analysis-ready, which does not reflect the real-world data wrangling challenges this project is designed to teach. Second, and more importantly, Kaggle datasets often have dubious provenance and unclear licensing: it is frequently difficult to trace where the data originally came from, how it was collected, and under what terms it can be reused. This raises concerns about data quality, ethical use, and reproducibility, all of which are central to this course. Projects using Kaggle datasets will therefore receive a 5% reduction in the final grade unless accompanied by a strong justification. Justifications will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and must address three points: 
(i) why this particular dataset was selected
(ii) what alternative datasets exist in the domain of interest, including a list of sources considered and the reasons they were not suitable, and 
(iii) why the project objectives were not adjusted to accommodate the limitations of available non-Kaggle data. 

Timeline: Provide a draft of the plan and timeline for completing your project. Include a list of specific tasks you need to accomplish, a brief description of each task, when each task will be completed, and who will be responsible for completing it..
Your plan must clearly address each of the requirements described above

Constraints: Describe any known limitations or challenges with your datasets or approach. These might include legal or ethical restrictions, unknown data provenance, technical difficulties in processing the data, issues with data completeness, limited temporal or spatial coverage, accessibility barriers, or other relevant concerns that could affect your work..

Gaps: Identify any known gaps or areas where you need additional input.

Your plan should anticipate later course topics even if you don’t yet know all the details. It is expected that your plan will evolve over time.
